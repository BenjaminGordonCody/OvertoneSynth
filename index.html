        An overtone series is a sequence of musical tones in which each
        frequency is an integer multiple of the first tone. Eg, if the first
        tone in a sequence is 110hz (A2), the next notes in the overtone series
        would be 220hz (A3), 330hz (E4-ish), 440hz(A4), 550hz(C#5-ish) and so
        on. Overtone series occur naturally when a fundamental is resonated or
        reflected, and as such a sound's reflected overtones determine much of
        what a listener percieves as the "character" of a sound.

          Western harmony derives many of its structures from the mathematical
          relationships of these series.
        </a>
        This synthesizer plays the overtone series that comes from a fundamental
        note of 300hz (which we might call "D half sharp"). As such, it will be
        equally out of tune with all traditional instruments.
